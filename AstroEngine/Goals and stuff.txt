To keep things on track:

TODO LIST:
-Restructure engine, is currently spaghetti code


Structure:

-Base Drawable Class: Contains rendering information
-Base Target Class: Stuff you can render to
-Base System Class: Systems that form a scene
-Base Manager Class: Managers that form the game
-Base Scriptable Class: Self explanatory

Everything goes back to one of those base classes, unless it is in
a subsystem of some sort.

Example structure:

-Window: Inherits Target
-Tile system: Inherits Drawable, System
-Input: Inherits System, Manager
